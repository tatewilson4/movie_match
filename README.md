### About
We built a full-stack application using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and Angular. This app is for any user that wants to bookmark different movies to watch. Any User can post, edit, delete, and comment movie reccomendations on the community board. If the user wants to add bookmarks to there list, they can login and do so. They can also go to the community board and get reccomendations for other movies. If we had more time we would have added a featured movie roulette board. This would basically take a movie from a list of reccomended movies. Next, it would spin an wheel and give you a movie. The user would be able to click the roulette as many times as they wished. 

Deployed through Heroku

Sessions- Used to create a login page in which you create a name and a password. The password is encrypted so hackers cannot retrieve personal information. Also used to log user out.

Users- Used to login to your account if you created one.

We used Node.js, Mongoose, Express, Angular and OMDBAPI. This app had the MVC file structure, aside from the views file. Since EJS was not used we had our index page in the public folder.  Different routes load specific parts of the website if action is committed. Node.js, Mongoose, Express, Angular and OMDBAPI all worked together to make the website functional.

Future Upgrades - We would like to get the roulette board up and running. We would also like for there to be a chat room option. In this chat room users could talk about different movies on the spot and get a good reccomendation.
